# Personal Card

This is my personal digital business card.

## Usage

Open your terminal and run:

```shell
npx simongolms
```

## Inspiration

I was inspired to create this digital business card by [@bitandbang](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang) and [@johnbwoodruff](https://github.com/johnbwoodruff/card). It's such a cool idea to run a simple `npx` command and get info about me and where to find my work. Plus, I doubt anyone will ever want to write an npm package called `simongolms`, so I figured I wasn't being irresponsible.
